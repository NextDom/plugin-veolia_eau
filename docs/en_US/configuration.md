The "Service Télé relevé" must be activated at Veolia (You can do it from the website under the heading "Your contracts" if your water meter allows it).

Your water consumption will be recovered every day.

### Debug mode

The debug mode allows you to run every minute for one hour, recovering the data. It should be limited to debugging.

Leaving the debug mode permanently will affect the life of the storage medium, especially SD cards, and drain the battery of the device more quickly.
